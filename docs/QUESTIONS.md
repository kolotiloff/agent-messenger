# Open questions

Questions that need the owner's answer or a discussion before work can go on. Agents add questions here instead of guessing. When a question is answered, write the answer and the date, record the result in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) if it is a decision, and move the entry to **Answered**.

Format: ID, question, why it matters, options, which tasks it blocks.

## Open

### Q-001: Which language should the app UI use?
The window and CLI messages are in Russian; code and docs are now in English. **Options:** keep Russian; switch to English; support both with a language setting. **Blocks:** T-019.

### Q-002: May the old remote branches be deleted?
There are about 26 `codex/*` and `cursor/*` branches. Their content is in `main`. Four of them have a separate history from before `main` was rebuilt, so they hold the original commit history. **Options:** delete all; delete only the branches already merged into `main` and keep the four; keep all. **Blocks:** T-018.

### Q-003: Is there an Apple Developer ID account for signing and notarization?
Without one, macOS can block the downloaded preview on another Mac. **Blocks:** T-013.

### Q-004: When can Cursor CLI be turned on?
Stage 2 requires all three CLIs. Until then Cursor stays off (D-011). **Blocks:** T-012.

### Q-005: How are acceptance runs on the Mac done?
Cloud sessions run on Linux. **Options:** the owner runs the steps from an agent's instructions and sends back the output; or the owner connects the Mac to the cloud session through Remote Control; or the owner works from a local tool (Cursor, Claude Code on the Mac). **Blocks:** T-004 and every later Mac acceptance.

### Q-006: Which Windows and Linux machines are available for stages 5–6, and when?
**Blocks:** T-015, T-016.

### Q-007: How does the managed Codex profile sign in?
Copying the owner's credentials into the managed profile is not implemented and must not be logged or published. A likely option is a standard login into the managed profile done by the owner. **Blocks:** T-004.

### Q-008: Switch to one-shot runs that resume a saved conversation?
Proposal in [RETHINK.md](RETHINK.md): run an agent once per message by exact resume, free the conversation after the process has exited and its group is empty, never retry automatically, and give workers real tools. It would relax D-004 in part and replace D-005 and D-016. Codex reviews it first. **Options:** accept; accept with changes; keep persistent processes. Also to decide if accepted: which permission mode `worker` agents run with. **Blocks:** T-009 and the stages after it.
